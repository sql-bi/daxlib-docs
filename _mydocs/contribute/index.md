A DAX library is a collection of DAX user-defined functions (UDFs) written in TMDL format. 

A DAX lib library is comprised of:

- `manifest.daxlib`: metadata, such as the library name, version, and author
- `functions.tmdl`: DAX UDF functions

It can also include optional files, such as `README.md` and/or `icon.png`.

> Follow the [naming conventions](naming-conventions.md) for both the folder structure, library and function names

Users can contribute a library via a pull request (PR) to `daxlib/daxlib`. Once approved, the library is published on [daxlib.org](https://daxlib.org/), making it available for browsing, installation, and use.

## Types of Libraries

Depending on your DAX library's size and complexity, you can choose one of the following methods to contribute it to DAX Lib:

### Small Library

In this mode you develop your library on a personal fork of `daxlib/daxlib` (`<youraccount>/daxlib`), then submit a PR to `daxlib/daxlib` to submit your library, and your library will be released on daxlib.org. 

For in-depth steps follow the [Contribute Small Libraries to DAX Lib](fork-daxlib.md) guide.

#### Small Library Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant DaxLib as daxlib.org
    participant Main as daxlib/daxlib
    participant Fork as <youraccount>/daxlib
    
    Main->>Fork: 1. Fork repository
    Fork->>Fork: 2. Develop library
    Fork->>Main: 3. Submit pull request
    Main->>Main: 4. Review & merge
    Main->>DaxLib: 5. Package deployed
```

#### Small Library Structure

`daxlib/daxlib` has the structure below. You can add your library under `packages/<firstletterofyouraccountname>`.

```bash
.
└── packages/
    ├── a/
    ├── .../
    ├── y/
    │   └── your.library/
    │       ├── 0.1.0/
    │       └── 0.1.1/
    │           ├── lib/
    │           │   └── functions.tmdl   # Required - Your DAX UDF functions
    │           ├── icon.png             # Optional - Icon for your library
    │           ├── README.md            # Optional - Docs for your library
    │           └── manifest.daxlib      # Required - Declares package properties
    ├── .../
    └── z/
```

### Medium/Large Library

The process for Medium/Large libraries uses a extended workflow.

We still need a fork of `daxlib/daxlib` (`<youraccount>/daxlib`), and will still submit a pull request to `daxlib/daxlib` to publish a library.

The difference is that development of the library will occur on a fork of `daxlib/lib-quickstart-template` (`<youraccount>/<yourlibrary>`). A github workflow can be run on `<youraccount>/<yourlibrary>`, which will push the library to a new, version specific, branch of `<youraccount>/daxlib`, which can then be submitted via a pull request to `daxlib/daxlib`.

For in-depth steps follow the [Contribute Medium-Large Libraries to DAX Lib](github-repo.md) guide.

#### Medium/Large Library Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant DaxLib as daxlib.org
    participant Main as daxlib/daxlib
    participant Fork as <youraccount>/daxlib
    participant LibRepo1 as <youraccount>/<yourlibrary>
    
    Main->>Fork: 1. Fork repository
    LibRepo1->>LibRepo1: 2. Develop library
    LibRepo1->>Fork: 3. Workflow creates branch
    Fork->>Main: 4. Submit pull request
    Main->>Main: 5. Review & merge
    Main->>DaxLib: 6. Package deployed
```

#### Medium/Large Library Structure

`daxlib/lib-quickstart-template` has the following structure. The the structure is slightly different from the Small library, but the required content remain the same, except your library now lives in the `src` folder.

```bash
.
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── publish-package.yml   # Workflow to create branch on `<youraccount>/daxlib` with your library version
└── src/
    ├── lib/
    │   └── functions.tmdl        # Required - Your DAX UDF functions
    ├── icon.png                  # Optional - Icon for your library
    ├── README.md                 # Optional - Docs for your library
    └── manifest.daxlib           # Required - Declares package properties
```

#### Why Create a Medium/large Library?

Since you have a specific repo dedicated to your library you are able to:

- Connect with your users with GitHub issues
- Collaborate with others to develop the library
- Add [documentation site](docs-site.md) and host (for example) on GitHub Pages
